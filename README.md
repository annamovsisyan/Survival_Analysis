Telecom Customer Churn & CLV Prediction

Introduction

This repository houses a comprehensive survival analysis project aimed at understanding customer churn and predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) within a telecommunications context. By leveraging advanced statistical modeling techniques, this project provides actionable insights into customer behavior and retention strategies.

Project Details

What We Do
Model Customer Churn: Apply Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) models to predict when customers are likely to leave.
Calculate CLV: Determine the lifetime value of customers using survival probabilities and revenue data.
Insightful Visualizations: Offer visual interpretations of complex data to spotlight key trends and patterns.
Strategic Recommendations: Based on the analysis, propose tailored strategies to enhance customer retention.
Dataset Overview
The project utilizes a detailed dataset comprising various attributes related to customer demographics, service usage, and churn history:

Personal details like Age, Income, and Marital Status
Service-related features including Tenure, Internet, Voice, and Forwarding services
Churn Status indicating whether a customer has left the company

Analytical Results

Model Performance: Compare various AFT models to understand which best predicts churn.
Customer Lifetime Value: Insights into which segments have higher or lower CLV.
Retention Strategies: Based on CLV and churn risk, what strategies could potentially improve retention.
